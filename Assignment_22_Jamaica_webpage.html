                  Jamaica’s physical features is mostly mountainous. A limestone
                  plateau covers two-thirds of the island and karst formations
                  with caverns and caves dominate the island. Additionally, it
                  has narrow coastal plains, green dense rainforests and sandy
                  bays and beaches.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Generally, the island’s physical feature can be divided into
                  three main types of landforms: the central mountain chain
                  formed by igneous and metamorphic rocks; the karst limestone
                  hills in the Cockpit area; the low-lying coastal plains and
                  interior valleys. Limestone formation occurs all over the
                  island, but especially in the western areas.

                  Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea,
                  after Cuba and Hispaniola. Jamaica is about 146 miles (235 km)
                  long and varies from 22 to 51 miles (35 to 82 km) wide.

                  The island is renowned for its diverse ecosystems, including
                  stunted, elfin forests on the highest peaks, rainforests in
                  the valleys, savannas, and dry sandy areas supporting only
                  cacti and other xerophytic plants.

               <p>
                  In Jamaica, the climate is tropical, hot all year round, with
                  little difference between winter and summer (just a few
                  degrees). Even in winter, daytime temperatures are around
                  27/30 °C (81/86 °F) and night-time temperatures around 20/23
                  °C (68/73 °F). The southern coast, where Kingston is located,
                  is slightly warmer in the winter months, in fact the maximum
                  temperature is around 30 °C (86 °F) even in January.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Rainfall occurs mainly in the form of thunderstorm in late
                  afternoon. In almost all of Jamaica, except on the west coast
                  (see Negril), in July there is a relative lull in
                  precipitation, and in any case, there are two peaks in May and
                  October, that is, at the beginning and the end of the period.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The rain pattern is also due to the north-east trade winds,
                  which are typical of the Tropics, and blow from November to
                  March. Along the northern coast of Jamaica, rainfall ranges
                  between 1,200 and 1,800 millimeters (47 and 70 inches) per
                  year.

                  Spanish colonists had virtually exterminated the aboriginal
                  Taino people by the time the English invaded the island in
                  1655. The Spaniards themselves escaped the island or were
                  expelled shortly afterward. The population of English settlers
                  remained small, but they brought in vast numbers of African
                  slaves to work the sugar estates.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Today the population consists predominantly of the descendants
                  of those slaves, with a small proportion of people of mixed
                  African and European descent. Even fewer in number are people
                  who trace their ancestry to the United Kingdom, India, China,
                  the Middle East, Portugal, and Germany.

                  English, the official language, is commonly used in towns and
                  among the more-privileged social classes. Jamaican Creole is
                  also widely spoken. Its vocabulary and grammar are based in
                  English, but its various dialects derive vocabulary and
                  phrasing from West African languages, Spanish, and, to a
                  lesser degree, French. The grammatical structure, lyrical
                  cadences, intonations, and pronunciations of Creole make it a
                  distinct language.

                  Surprisingly, Jamaica only has three officially desginated
                  cities -- Kingston, Portmore and Montego Bay.

                  Freedom of worship is guaranteed by Jamaica’s constitution.
                  Most Jamaicans are Protestant. The largest denominations are
                  the Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal churches. Only a
                  small proportion of Jamaicans attend the Anglican church,
                  which, as the Church of England, was the island’s only
                  established church until 1870.

                  The Jewish community is one of the oldest in the Western
                  Hemisphere. Jamaica also has a small Hindu population and
                  small numbers of Muslims and Buddhists. There are some
                  religious movements that combine elements of both Christianity
                  and West African traditions.

                  The central feature of the Pukumina sect, for example, is
                  spirit possession; the Kumina sect has rituals characterized
                  by drumming, dancing, and spirit possession. Obeah (Obia) and
                  Etu similarly recall the cosmology of Africa, while Revival
                  Zion has elements of both Christian and African religions.

                  Rastafarianism has been an important religious and cultural
                  movement in Jamaica since the 1930s and has attracted
                  adherents from the island’s poorest communities, although it
                  represents only a small proportion of the total population.
                  Rastafarians believe in the divinity of Emperor Haile Selassie
                  I of Ethiopia and in the eventual return of his exiled
                  followers to Africa.

                  Jamaica’s cultural development has been deeply influenced by
                  British traditions and a search for roots in folk forms. The
                  latter are based chiefly on the colourful rhythmic intensity
                  of the island’s African heritage.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Jamaican culture is a product of the interaction between
                  Europe and Africa. Terms such as “Afro-centred” and
                  “Euro-centred,” however, are often used to denote the
                  perceived duality in Jamaican cultural traditions and values.
                  European influences persist in public institutions, medicine,
                  Christian worship, and the arts. However, African continuities
                  are present in religious life, Jamaican Creole language,
                  cuisine, proverbs, drumming, the rhythms of Jamaican music and
                  dance, traditional medicine (linked to herbal and spiritual
                  healing), and tales of Anansi, the spider-trickster.
